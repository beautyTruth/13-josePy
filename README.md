# Generators With Python

Welcome to hump day, August 02, 2023. Today is a day where I will be learning all about Python generators. Sleep has been good. Walking and lifting have been good. My creation has been good, but low in quantity -- mostly ad libbing songs while I wash dishes.

There was a lull in my Python learning progress while I read over the acceptance materials for my upcoming IBM data science training. I signed up for the course through the VA at the beginning of July and I was notified that I was accepted for entry yesterday. The training begins on Monday and has just sort of fallen into my lap, but I think it is going to be a good thing. It's aligned with my overall goal of achieving my TensorFlow certification one year from now, so I am excited. According to the syllabus, there is a lot of Python instruction involved in the training, so it is fortuitous that I am finishing up with Jose's boot camp beforehand.

With that in mind, I'm off to learn about Python generators.
